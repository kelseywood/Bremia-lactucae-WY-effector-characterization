### Paper on BioRxiv: [Effector prediction and characterization in the oomycete pathogen Bremia lactucae reveal host-recognized WY domain proteins that lack the canonical RXLR motif](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679787v2.supplementary-material)

This repository contains scripts to analyze oomycete genomes for WY effector prediction and characterization, specifically focusing on the causal agent of lettuce downy mildew, *Bremia lactucae*.


### [Supplemental motif table with Species, GeneID, sequence, various motif presences](https://github.com/mjnur/Bremia-lactucae-WY-effector-characterization/blob/master/motif_counting/20200805_Supplemental_motif_category_table.csv)

Note that the various RXLR string searches were done on non-redundant genomes with cleaved sequences, but the CSV contains the full sequence. Genomes were made non-redundant using CD-HIT, and cleaved using SignalP 4.1, on sensitive mode.
